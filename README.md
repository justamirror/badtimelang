# Badtime Lang

## The heck is this?

Badtime Lang is a programming language that compiles to `.csv` files for the [Bad Time Simulator](http://jcw87.github.io/c2-sans-fight/) website.

Why though?



1. Editing Excel spreadsheets can feel mentally dreadful.
2. More control structures than the bare `.csv` file.
3. Doesnâ€™t use `PascalCase`, instead uses `camelCase`.
4. Expression evaluator (math stuff like `10 + 20 + 30`) without using the math commands.

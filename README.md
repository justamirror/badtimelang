# Badtime Lang

## The heck is this?

Badtime Lang is a programming language that compiles to `.csv` files for the
[Bad Time Simulator](http://jcw87.github.io/c2-sans-fight/) website.

Why though?


1. Editing Excel spreadsheets can feel mentally dreadful.
2. More control structures than the bare `.csv` file.
3. Doesnâ€™t use `PascalCase`, instead uses `camelCase`.
4. Expression evaluator (math stuff like `10 + 20 + 30`) without using the math
   commands.

4a. You can also use math functions (`$sin`, `$floor`, `$angle`, etc).

## Ok, but how do I *use* it? \[Install and Getting Started\]

To install badtimelang, you first need deno installed. To do that, check [Installation | Manual | Deno](https://deno.land/manual@v1.36.4/getting_started/installation). Then you can use `deno install badtime`.

# Including files

Including files is easy as one, two, three! Well, not *really*, but you'll see.

To include a file, do this! `include hello.bt` or `include "hello.bt"` (it will *not* work if you don't supply the file extension, as it will assume you are importing from std or modules folder (TODO: modules folder).

It will now be available in `$hello`, with functions being exposed publically (TODO: Also variables).

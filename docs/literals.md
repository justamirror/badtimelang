# Literals

## Numbers

To create a number simply type out the number (easy.)
Like: `10` and `10.2`

## Strings

To create a string do `"hey"` or `'hey'`. You can also do string escapes like `"hey\""` or `"hey\n"`. *However* strings **cannot** have a comma in them due to the limits of the csv parser of bad time simulator.
